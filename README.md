# Python Webcam-based Face Detector

This project is a Python-based application that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time using the webcam. It captures video frames, analyzes them using a face detection algorithm, and highlights the detected faces in the video stream.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using the webcam
- Ability to draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Option to display the number of faces detected in the video stream
- Adjustable parameters for face detection accuracy and speed
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Usage

1. Run the main script: python face_detector.py
2. Adjust the parameters for face detection if necessary (e.g., confidence threshold, scale factor)
3. The webcam feed will open, and the detected faces will be highlighted
4. Press 'Q' or 'Ctrl+C' to exit the program
